# BeamMP-Speed-Limiter
Hate people going stupid speeds or using node grab everywhere? This plugin will kick them!

## Installing
Simply put the "Resources" folder directly in your main BeamMP server directory. To change the set speed limits, open the "main.lua" file and change the top values to new ones in MPH.
